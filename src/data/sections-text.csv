1,section 1,"Let’s say that before tariffs, the fictional company “U.S. Grocery” was importing avocados from Mexico for <span class=""text-avocado"">$1.00</span>, then selling them to U.S. consumers for <span class=""text-consumer"">$1.50</span>."
2,section 2,"If the U.S. government places a 25 percent tariff on Mexican goods, U.S. Grocery must pay a <span class=""text-tariff"">$0.25 tax</span> to the U.S. government for each avocado (25% of $1.00). If U.S. Grocery wants to continue making <span class=""text-profit"">$0.50 in profit</span>, it must raise the price of avocados from $1.50 to <span class=""text-consumer"">$1.75</span>, “passing on” the $0.25 tariff to consumers. That is what usually happens, according to most economists."
3,section 3,"Alternatively, U.S. Grocery could decide to reduce its <span class=""text-profit"">profit</span> in order to keep its price at <span class=""text-consumer"">$1.50</span>. To restore its profits, U.S. Grocery would have to cut costs elsewhere, including by lowering wages, laying off workers, or investing less in its business."
4,section 4,"If U.S. Grocery could replace its Mexican supplier with a U.S. supplier, it would avoid the tariff. This is one goal of tariffs: to support U.S. companies struggling to compete with cheaper imports. But <span class=""text-avocado"">U.S. suppliers’ prices</span> are likely to be significantly higher—generally because of higher labor costs and production standards—and switching suppliers is difficult and expensive in practice."
